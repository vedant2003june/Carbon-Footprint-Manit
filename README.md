# 🌱 Carbon Footprint Assessment of MANIT Campus

This project presents a data-driven analysis of the carbon footprint of MANIT Bhopal’s 650-acre campus. Emissions from electricity use, vehicles, human respiration, solid waste, and infrastructure were calculated using institutional data and standard emission factors (IPCC, national studies).

We also estimated carbon absorption from ~140,000 trees on campus to assess the net environmental impact.

## 🔍 Key Results:
- *Total emissions*: ~731 tons CO₂/year  
- *Carbon absorption*: ~3,859 tons CO₂/year  
- *Net footprint*: –3,128 tons CO₂/year (Net Negative)

## 💡 Key Contributions:
- Built a zone-wise emission model using real-world campus data
- Identified major emission sources and low-impact zones
- Proposed actionable sustainability measures (e.g., green roofs, composting, EVs)

This research demonstrates applied environmental analytics and strategic thinking—relevant for roles in data-driven decision-making, sustainability, and business operations.
